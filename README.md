#CobolOption
Type Option represents an optional value: every Option is either Some and contains a value, or None, and does not.
The inspiration in Java code was found here: https://github.com/mariofusco/javaz/blob/master/src/main/java/org/javaz/Option.java
It is not about how Option type has to be written but just to acomplish the same result with COBOL JVM
